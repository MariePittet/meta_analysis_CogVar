# meta_analysis_CogVar
Meta-analysis of the known-group validity (Hedges g) of various cognitive tests, i.e. the capacity of these tests to discriminate patients from controls. 
The study data will be included upon publication.

The project contains two R codes: a risk of bias assessment using ROBVIS, and the meta-analysis with a forest plot visualization.
The random-effect model allows for study-to-study differences in the discrimination power, which is expected since different tests are used to target the same construct.
The meta-analysis is separated in various subcomponents of the construct of interest (here social cognition). 
It also calculates separate summary indices for different clinical population.
